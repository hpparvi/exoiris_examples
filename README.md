# ExoIris Examples

**Author:** Hannu Parviainen

This repository contains examples of using [ExoIris](https://github.com/hpparvi/ExoIris) for exoplanet transmission 
spectroscopy. The examples are not full-featured tutorials but rather show how one would normally use the code to 
perform a specific analysis. Tutorials can be found in the [ExoIris documentation](https://exoiris.readthedocs.io/),
and should be read before attempting to understand the examples here.

This repository is a living collection of examples, and will be updated as new examples are added. 

**Note:** The repository does not contain the data used in the examples, but the data needs to be downloaded separately.
Instructions for downloading the data can be found in the `data/README.md` file in each example directory.

## Examples

- **WASP-39 b Early Release Science joint analysis**

  The WASP-39 b joint analysis example consists of a number of Jupyter notebooks that show how to use ExoIris to 
  perform a number of different analyses. The main joint analysis of all the WASP-39 b ERS data is carried out in
  the `a1` notebooks, while the `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` notebooks show how to perform the individual analyses.
